# 🛍️ Retail Sales Analysis

This project from 3MTT explores transaction data from a retail store using Python. The goal is to extract meaningful insights, discover patterns, and visualize trends in customer behavior, sales performance, and operational metrics.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on retail transactions.
- Visualize trends in product performance, sales, and customer preferences.
- Identify top-performing branches and payment methods.
- Highlight customer feedback and satisfaction via ratings.

## 📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes the following fields:
- Invoice ID, Branch, City, Customer Type, Gender
- Product line, Unit Price, Quantity, Tax, Total
- Date, Time, Payment Method
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), Gross Margin, Gross Income
- Customer Rating

## 📊 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis presentation

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Most sales occur on weekends**, especially Saturdays.
- **E-wallet users tend to leave higher ratings**.
- **Certain product lines consistently outperform others** in total sales.
- **Branch B generated the highest gross income**.

## 🧠 What's Included
- `retail_sales_analysis.ipynb` — Full Jupyter notebook with all code and visualizations.
- `Dataset.csv` — The cleaned dataset used for the analysis.
- `README.md` — This project summary and documentation.

## 🧰 How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `retail_sales_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis.

## 🚀 Future Work
- Add an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Dash.
- Integrate predictive analytics (e.g., predict ratings or sales).
- Deploy as a portfolio project website.
